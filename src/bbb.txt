Just call this chapter “Design Eye for the Inheritance
Guy.” We’ll re-examine the typical overuse of inheritance and you’ll learn how
to decorate your classes at runtime using a form of object composition. Why?
Once you know the techniques of decorating, you’ll be able to give your (or
someone else’s) objects new responsibilities without making any code changes
to the underlying classes.
